# Anemos

![Anemos](docs/AnemosBanner3.png)

Anemos is a holding protocol designed for volatile token ecosystems. It rewards consistent onchain behavior-not snapshots, staking, or farming. Projects lock dev supply into our **Aether Vaults**, and supply is streamed to top holders over time based on signal.

---

## How It Works

- Projects connect their token to Anemos
- They lock a portion of dev supply into a vault
- Anemos Agents monitor holders onchain
- Tokens are distributed to consistent wallets over time

---

## Key Concepts

### Aether Engine
The core system that evaluates wallet behavior based on:
- Holding consistency
- Volatility resistance
- Interaction frequency (not volume)

### Aether Vaults
A reward system that streams locked supply to qualified holders. No claims, no snapshots-just passive reward flow.

### Signal Rating
An internal scoring system used to determine which wallets qualify for vault emissions.
