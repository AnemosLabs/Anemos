# Agent Network

Anemos Agents are lightweight scanning modules deployed across the network. Each Agent operates independently, listening to wallet activity and scoring addresses using the Aether Engine.

## Roles

- **Scanner:** Detects holder behavior patterns
- **Evaluator:** Calculates signal rating based on volatility resistance
- **Notifier:** Triggers vault streaming events when thresholds are hit

## Future Plans

- Agent clustering based on token type
- Multi-chain listening capability
- Behavior heatmaps and explorer integration
